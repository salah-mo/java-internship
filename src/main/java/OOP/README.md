# Week-3 Task

## Task: Library Management System

Design and implement a simple Library Management System using Java, focusing on object-oriented programming principles.
The system should allow users to manage library resources, such as books, magazines, and DVDs.

### Requirements

- Define classes for books, magazines, and DVDs with appropriate attributes (e.g., title, author, publication year).
- Implement methods to perform operations on library resources, such as adding, updating, and deleting items.
- Implement methods within classes to encapsulate behavior related to library resources (e.g., display information,
  check availability).
- Define constructors for classes to initialize object attributes during instantiation.
